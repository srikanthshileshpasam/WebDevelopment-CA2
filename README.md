# FULL STACK FRAMEWORKS


## My Fourth Milestone Project

Throughout this project I will be using the Technologies that I have learnt so far from Code Institue.
This project will consist of HTML5 in Jinja format, CSS3, JQuery, JavaScript, Python/Django(Frameworks) and Sqlite.
I will be using Travis for Test and also Deployment Technologies like Heroku and AWS3(Images)

The site designed was an online ecommerce auction based app that can earn money for the owner.
User can learn and know about the artefact before biding or purchasing.
You have to be registered to place a bid.

Registered user are allowed to either wait until auction ends or buy product directly.
Winnner is decided when bid has closed!

All databases used was stored and retrived in the backend via sqlite3.
I have decided to follow the project requirements provided in brief.

## UX

The UX for this project is easy and understandable. It is mainly an ecommerce web based application that functions perfectly. 
Navigations are quite easy and smooth for users. The application is intuitive to use and has information on it presented well.
There is a search input box that allows user to narrow/navigate thier search through the application. 
The web application allows user to create, read(view), edit(update) and make payment without any interferenc.

The data schema used displays perfectly throughout the form thus allowing user to implement the CRUD rule perfectly. 
The images used are stored in a static folder
The colour scheme was very simple and makes the site quite clear and readable enough for users.
Fonts sizes are also considered for good readability.
The site also has some interactivity functions but minimal.
This application is very easy for a user to manipulate and understand.


## Features 

* Navbar - Materialize was used for quick production of modern CSS and use of their predefinded classes.

* Images - Flask werkzeug was used to allow user attach image files. Images used are acquired via google.

* Card - Materialize predefinded classes was used for great UX view. 

* Button/Links - Was used to allow/trigger users intentions/actions on application.

* Font Awesome -  Icons was used to improve the UX for each logo when viewed by a user/visitor.

* Forms/Search Bar - Materialize and Flask WTForms was helpful with predefined classes usable in Jinja templates.

* Wireframing- I just did some mock ups on paper with pen of how the site generally should look and feel. 


### Possible feature to implement 

* User Profile - Try to add ability for a user to view profile section
* Reviews - Try to allow user leave a review on purchased/ bided product
* 


### Getting Started

The website is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript and JQuery** for interactivity, **Python**, **Bootstrap** frameworks, **Django** frameworks

### Prerequisites

The site is fully functional without any local files needed to be downloaded all frameworks and scripts
used are loaded via an approved CDN. Before deployment the site was tested on several browsers and devices.
This site is supported on all browsers. Check below for tested devices and browsers.

## Deployment

### AWS3 Deployment

Created a new  **AWS3** account where the project images will be deployed unto.
At first, use a **git remote** command to link project with new repo.
Then use the **git push -u origin master** command to push codes and every change into new repo

Using the CLI in terminal to call **git init** to start git initialization on the project.
This allows a file/files to be added to the Github repo by calling a **git add** command.
Then any added file/files is being commited with a **git commit -m "commit message"** command.
Afterwards, the file is been pushed with **git push** where Github username + password is required.
Once successful, code will be deployed into your repo and **git status** command should indicate branch tree clean.


### Heroku Deployment

Created a new app on **Heroku** where the app is hosted live.
At first, to allow **Heroku** locate application we login into the CLI using ** heroku login -i** command.
You will be requested to imput username and password for **Heroku** account. 
After which you can request **Heroku Apps** via CLI. 

Knowing the apps you need to pass deployment into then we can use **heroku git:remote -a <app>** 
to allow Git automatically update deployment in Heroku. 
Once this has been remotely passed . 
To host the app unto heroku pass the IP and PORT config to match the route **__main__** config.

To allow git to push to heroku the command **git push heroku master** must be called for a final **push**.
For a succefull and healthy push it is best adviced to have the **requirement.txt** and **Procfile** 
files installed or updated. Most especially for **requirement.txt** file which gave me a lot of challenges,
it requires to be updated along with any installed packages so it can depoly successfully, i.e Flask packages.



### HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, Python

All my mark up is **HTML valid**
All my styling is **CSS valid**
All my syntax is **JavaScript syntactically valid**
All my routing is **Python valid**

#### Version Used

I use [GitHub](github.com) for version control. Which backup my code incase I encounter a bug or an error that needs urgent fix. 
I can easily traceback my code on GitHub.
